# Introduction:-

The bank has a growing customer base. The bank wants to increase borrowers (asset customers) base to bring in more loan business and earn more through the interest on loans. So , the bank wants to convert the liability based customers to personal loan customers. (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. The department wants to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign.

# Objective:-

The classification goal is to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans.

This is classification problem. We can solve this problem using following steps:

1. Importing Necessary Packages

2. Data Collection and Visualization

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

4. Data Cleaning

5. Transformations for Feature Variables

6. Train-Test Split of Data

7. Applying Logistic Regression Model

8. Model Evaluation

9. Building various other classification Algorithms and its comparison

10. Business Understanding of this Model

# Business Understanding of this Model
There are various positive aspects of this Machine Learning Model.

1. It will be helpful in targeting the particular customer.
2. It will be helpful in minimize the unneccessary spending on less valuable things.
3. It will also helpful in more accuracy while predicting the customer.

This model not only useful in this type of sector but also we can use another sectors just by changing data and some code. This is very helpful to increase the growth of the business.
