# Introduction:-

The bank has a growing customer base. The bank wants to increase borrowers (asset customers) base to bring in more loan business and earn more through the interest on loans. So , the bank wants to convert the liability based customers to personal loan customers. (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. The department wants to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of purchasing the loan. This will increase the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign.

# Objective:-

The classification goal is to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans.

This is classification problem. We can solve this problem using following steps:

1. Importing Necessary Packages

2. Data Collection and Visualization

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

4. Data Cleaning

5. Transformations for Feature Variables

6. Train-Test Split of Data

7. Applying Logistic Regression Model

8. Model Evaluation

9. Building various other classification Algorithms and its comparison

10. Business Understanding of this Model
